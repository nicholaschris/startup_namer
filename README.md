# startup_namer

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. Combining different flutter tutorials.

These are the resources that I've been through so far.

- [Codelab part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/#0)
- [Layout tutorial](https://flutter.io/docs/development/ui/layout/tutorial)

## TODO: 
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

Flutter docs can be found here:  
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), they offer tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
